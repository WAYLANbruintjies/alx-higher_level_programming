TDD

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

Why Python programming is awesome
What’s an interactive test
Why tests are important
How to write Docstrings to create tests
How to write documentation for each module and function
What are the basic option flags to create tests
How to find edge cases

Tasks:

0. Integers addition
mandatory
Write a function that adds 2 integers.
Prototype: def add_integer(a, b=98):
File: 0-add_integer.py, tests/0-add_integer.txt

1. Divide a matrix
mandatory
Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.
Prototype: def matrix_divided(matrix, div):
File: 2-matrix_divided.py, tests/2-matrix_divided.txt

2. Say my name
mandatory
Write a function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>
Prototype: def say_my_name(first_name, last_name=""):
File: 3-say_my_name.py, tests/3-say_my_name.txt

3. Print square
mandatory
Write a function that prints a square with the character #.
Prototype: def print_square(size):
File: 4-print_square.py, tests/4-print_square.txt

4. Text indentation
mandatory
Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and :
Prototype: def text_indentation(text):
File: 5-text_indentation.py, tests/5-text_indentation.txt

5. Max integer - Unittest
mandatory
Since the beginning you have been creating “Interactive tests”. For this exercise, you will add Unittests.
In this task, you will write unittests for the function def max_integer(list=[]):
File: tests/6-max_integer_test.py

6. Matrix multiplication
#advanced
Write a function that multiplies 2 matrices:
File: 100-matrix_mul.py, tests/100-matrix_mul.txt

7. Lazy matrix multiplication
#advanced
Write a function that multiplies 2 matrices by using the module NumPy
To install it: pip3 install numpy==1.15.0
Prototype: def lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b):
File: 101-lazy_matrix_mul.py, tests/101-lazy_matrix_mul.txt

8. CPython #3: Python Strings
#advanced
reate a function that prints Python strings.
Prototype: void print_python_string(PyObject *p);
File: 102-python.c
